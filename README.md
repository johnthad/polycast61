# How to use Redux in Polymer 2

Rob Dodson's [Polycast #61](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PahsgJn0sgU) demonstrated how to use Redux in Polymer 1.X. I have adapted his lesson for Polymer-2.0-rcX.

In order to do things the Polymer 2 way, I am also using the polymer-2 branch of [Polymer Redux](https://github.com/tur-nr/polymer-redux).
